# Economics
Economics is the scientific study of natural resource distribution. The goal of economic theory is to provide a framwework to analyze resource distribution. The analytical tools must aid in economic decision making regarding questions of fairness, freedom, and autonomy. 

## Definitions

#### Health
The psychological well being of humans and animals alike.

#### Output
The amount of natural resource extraction per time unit.

#### Technology
Technology is synonymous to the word tool.

#### Logistics
The system of organization used to solve complex problems.

#### Manipulation 
Manipulation is the process of extraction, refinement, and logistics of resources. 

#### Pollution
The rate and type of unwanted externalities during resource manipulation. Externalities are the side effects of resource manipulation forced by technology. 

#### Optimization
A mathematical term that describes the methods used to meet certain well defined goal criteria.

#### Politics
Politics is the system of governance involved in matters of output, pollution, technology and optimization.

#### Taxation
Taxation is a method of coercive resource redistribution to an enemy

#### Central Bank
A political institution that controls the credit swap system

#### Transaction Cost
Unproductive endeavours.

#### Credit Swap System (CSS, Money)
Synonymous to Money. A system of wealth book keeping and a means of trade.

14. How much time is necessary for an external resource dependent area to become independent? Agriculture and living.
15. What is the level of resource manipulation redundancy in terms of external risks/threats?

## Economic Psychology

### Population Density
Population density has psychological implications that govern human and animal behaviour. As population density increases, behaviour degenerates. The degeneration of behaviour is an effect of the limitations of the human mind as to how many people can be known and trusted. The number is low compared to the population of densly populated areas. Social norms break apart as populations increase. Communication suffers. All densly populated areas inevitably fall due to this phenomenom.

Degenerations increases violence. Violence causes trauma. Trauma leads to ignorance. Ignorance leads to conflict. Conflict decreases trust. Low levels of trust makes people fearful. Fear and ignorace corrupts systems. A corrupted system degenerates further and breaks apart. 

Poorly designed cities that do not take the psychological aspects of life into account naturally breaks apart and are left desolate. This phenomenon can be observed in all life on earth.

### Trauma
Trauma governs misbehaviour. One form of misbehaviour is unfair resource distribution. Unfair resource distribution is defined as a group of people taking more resources for themselfes than what is necessary, at the cost of others suffering resource shortages.

The ones who engaged in misbehaviour will justify their actions as fair, even thought the suffering of the other is clear. The justification is based on past unfairness that is repeated, projected and used as justification in circular arguments. Thinking from foundational principles becomes impossible. Whatever system that is in place is used as evidence for justified misbehaviour. 

Idolization is another way to put it. Creating false idols, and using the idolized as bait for unjust actions. The idolized are in a precarious position of both power and sudden loss. Since the power is unearned, sudden loss is just a matter of insight from those who idolize. 

High population density increases trauma. Bodies that are close inevitably collide. 

## Foundation

### Criteria for Output Optimization
1. Why is optimization of output necessary?
2. What are the criteria for optimization?
3. How do we select what the optimal level of output should be?
4. What variables fluctuate the level of output?

Output defines the rate of natural resource extraction. Output rate depends on population size and the technological living standard, 

## Taxation Analysis

## Appendix
### A Note on Classical Economics
Classical Economics is defined as the current (2024) leading economic theories that revolve around the theoretical assumptions, or manipulations, made by Richard Keynes. The Chicago School of Economics is based on sound reasoning but lacks theoretical maturity and idolizes government. The Austrian School of Economics is likewise based on sound reasoning in principal but does not aim to model anything.

The principles (or lack of principles) of classical economics makes errors of assumption. These assumptions serve to complicate and confuse economic theory. The foundational errors are the following:

### Credit swap systems (Money) 
Classic Economics take credit swap systems for granted. There is nothing inherently natural about such systems and therefore the theories of economics that takes systems for granted fail to provide scientific grounds for reasonable analysis. 

### Interest Rates
Interest rates are an arbitrary invention within credit swap systems that lacks reasonable purpose. It is a manipulation tactic to gain more from less lending. E.g. I give you 6 eggs today, in exchange for 7 eggs in a month. An unreasonable bargain. Central banks fail to motivate the existence of interest rates. Interest rates are set to some arbitrary value with no scientific justification.

### Taxation
From an objective standpoint, taxation is fraud. Fraud is defined as wrongful or criminal deception intented to result in financial or personal gain. Taxation is taken for granted by force.

### Corporations
Corporations can only be defined in relation to money and legislation. Corporations would not exist where it not for the legal and monetary benefits they provide. Corporations would be abolished if legislation was fair. 

### Employment
Employment can only be defined in relation to money and corporations. It is not a meaningful concept. Humans do not live to have corporate employment. 

The role of corporations and employment are both better modeled using agreement (contract). 

### Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
The measure of GDP is loosely defined as the sum of all monetary activity disconnected from actual resource manipulation. It is a senseless measure that does not aid in reasonable analysis. It is a manipulation tactic.

### GDP growth
Since GDP is senseless so is the growth thereof. It is a variable that blinds politicans and economists alike. 

### Equlibrium and the missing axiom
Classical economics revolve around the analysis of variable equlibrium. Systems reach a point of equlibrium by natural causes and fluctuate around that state. Classical macro economic theory fails to define an equlibrium for GDP. It is a free variable that makes the entire theory pointless. If GDP equlibrium was defined, it would have consequences for central banking and interest rates.

### Linear Models
Classical Economic theory is based on linear mathematical models that try to predict future economic activity. There is nothing linear about complicated human societies. Economic theories need more sophisticated mathematical tools if predictions are to be made. Predictions also need clear problem definitions. What can we predict and what should we try to predict? I.e. what is the goal of economic theory? Modern economics makes no effort in providing clarity.

Modern economic theory can be seen as a set of untested disconnected hypothesis.
