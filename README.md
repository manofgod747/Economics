# Economics
Economics is the scientific study of natural resource distribution. The goal of economic theory is to provide a framwework to analyze resource distribution. The analytical tools must aid in economic decision making regarding questions of fairness, freedom, and autonomy. 

## Definitions

#### Output
The amount of natural resource extraction per time unit.

#### Technology
Technology is synonymous to the word tool.

#### Logistics
The system of organization used to solve complex problems.

#### Manipulation 
Manipulation is the process of extraction, refinement, and logistics of resources. 

#### Pollution
The rate and type of unwanted externalities during resource manipulation. Externalities are the side effects of resource manipulation forced by technology. 

#### Optimization
A mathematical term that describes the methods used to meet certain well defined goal criteria.

#### Politics
Politics is the system of governance involved in matters of output, pollution, technology and optimization.

#### Transaction Cost
Unproductive endeavours.

## The Axioms of Economics

### Natural Axioms
1. Humans and psychology
3. Animals
4. Natural Resources

### Foundational Axioms
1. Output
2. Pollution
3. Politics
4. Technology
5. Transaction Cost

### Directional Axioms
1. Optimize Output
2. Minimize Pollution
3. Minimize Technology

## Foundation

### Criteria for Output Optimization
1. Why is optimization of output necessary?
2. What are the criteria for optimization?
3. How do we select what the optimal level of output is?
4. What variables fluctuate the level of output? 

## Appendix
### A Note on Classical Economics
Classical Economics is defined as the current (2024) leading economic theories that revolve around the theoretical assumptions made by Richard Keynes, The Chicago School of Economics...

The principles (or lack of principles) of classical economics makes errors of assumption. These assumptions serve to complicate and confuse economic theory. The foundational errors are the following:

### Credit swap systems (Money) 
Classic Economics take credit swap systems for granted. There is nothing inherently natural about such systems and therefore the theories of econmics that take systems for granted fail to provide scientific grounds for reasonable analysis. 

### Interest Rates
Interest rates are an arbitrary invention that lack reasonable purpose. Central banks fail to motivate the existence of interest rates. Interest rates are set to meet some arbitrary value with no scientific justification whatsoever.

### Taxation
From an objective standpoint, taxation is fraud. Fraud is defined as wrongful or criminal deception intented to result in financial or personal gain. Taxation is taken for granted because of force of habit.

### Employment
Employment can only be defined in relation to money. It is not a meaningful concept. 

### Corporations
Corporations can only be defined in relation to money and legislation. Corporations would not exist where it not for the legal and monetary benefits they provide. Corporations could be abolished if legislation was made fair. 

The role of corporations and employment are both better modeled using agreement (contract). 

### Gross National Product (GDP)
The measure of GDP is loosely defined as the sum of all monetary activity, disconnected from actual resource manipulation. It is a senseless measure that does not aid in reasonable analysis.

### GDP growth
Since GDP is senseless so is the growth thereof. It is a variable that blinds politicans and economists alike. 

### Equlibrium and the missing axiom
Classical economics revolve around the analysis of variable equlibrium. Systems reach a point of equlibrium by natural causes and fluctuate around that state. Classical macro economic theory fails to define an equlibrium for GDP. It is a free variable that makes the entire theory pointless.  

### Linear Models
Classical Economic theory is based on linear mathematical models that try to predict future economic activity. There is nothing linear about complicated human societies. Economic theories need more sophisticated mathematical tools if predictions are to be made.
